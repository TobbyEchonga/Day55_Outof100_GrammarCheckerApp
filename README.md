# Day55_Outof100_GrammarCheckerApp

This repository contains a Python project for a Grammar Checker.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Include dependencies like NLTK or other natural language processing libraries.
   'pip install language-tool-python'
2. Run the application: `grammar_checker_app.py`
3. Additional Notes:
    - This grammar checker is relatively basic and might not catch all possible errors.
    - LanguageTool supports multiple languages, and you can configure it accordingly.
    - For more advanced grammar checking and suggestions, you may explore commercial solutions like Grammarly or use more advanced natural language processing techniques.
    - Building a comprehensive grammar checker with high accuracy often involves using machine learning models trained on large annotated datasets, which is beyond the scope of a simple script.
